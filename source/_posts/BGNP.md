title: Ban Governments not people
---
we people of Iran are lonelier then ever! Iran’s Regime is blocking internet for people as white list, means we are allowed to access limited websites they specified for us.
They even blocked all kind of VPN’s and tunnels. in fact they block packets we’re sending if they don’t like it.

As you can see these are IP’s a single ICMP packet is passing.
it took about 600 ms a packet leaves iran’s IPs.
FYI we don’t have access to websites like: Youtube, Telegram, Twitter, Spotify, Instagram and etc.

In other hand we have companies are blocking Iranians, such as Cloudflare, Google, Apple, Yahoo and etc. they ban us in ways like blocking ip(cloudflare and google) or blocking phone numbers.
We can't make an account in these websites…
Let me tell you a funny story: Importing IPhone 14 to country is prohibited by regime. if you buy one in another country and bring it to Iran you can’t use it because apple don’t let you make apple ID as you are an Iranian.
I call it modern racism. we’re fighting our regime in our country every day by finding new ways to bypass firewall and when get access to “INTERNET” they will block our ip if they know we’re from Iran.
If you have problem with regime you should give Iranian access and I promise it’s worse punishment for I.R.I regime. The firewall is getting worse and worse and you help them with it.
