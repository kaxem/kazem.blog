title: Do not make company if you can't pay your employees properly
-----
Recentely I started to sending my resume to apply as a Devops Engineer.</br>
Every job offer I see has an endless list of requrements. and they offer minimum
payment, in Iran it is 5,400,000 tomans per mounth, that equals to 135$.</br>     This issue mostly includes small companies including 10-50 employees.
Some of these companies can’t even write a short description about what their doing or their goals or etc.
