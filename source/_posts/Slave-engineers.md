Recently I started to apply for a DevOps Engineer position.
Every job offer I saw, had an endless list of requirement skills. and they offer minimum payment, in Iran it is 5,400,000 tomans per mounth, that equals to 135$.
This issue mostly includes small companies with 10-50 employees.
Some of these companies can’t even write a short description about what their doing or their goals or etc.
Let’s review one of job offers I read in jobinja.com:</br>
>Job category:`IT / DevOps / Server`</br>
location location: `Tehran, Tehran`</br>
Type of cooperation: `Full-time`</br>
Minimum work experience: `Less than three years`</br>

I mean ***You don't even have a website or linkedin page...***
and it's obvious that they reject me because of insufficient technical knowledge<br>All I want to say is that don't run this kind of companies that you want to hire a full stack (we all know these requirements are above than a full stack developer skills) engineer or developer...</br>
stop making this kind of nonsense companies! I know your first priority is money, but you can't make it this way...
